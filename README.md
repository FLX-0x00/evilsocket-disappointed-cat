> **A single image to sum up all your feelings.**  

## What is this?  

This repository exists for one simple reason:  
To provide a **quick, effortless, and highly effective** way to respond to mindless, useless, and downright idiotic GitHub issues—just like [evilsocket](https://github.com/evilsocket) did.  

If you've ever felt the need to reply with *just* an image of a disappointed cat, **this is your one-stop solution**.  

## The Cat  

![The Cat](https://flx.dev/evilsocket-disappointed-cat/the-cat.jpg)  

## How to Use It  

The fastest way to implement *The Cat™* in your GitHub replies:  

1. **Copy this Markdown snippet**:  
   ```md
   ![disappointed-cat](https://flx.dev/evilsocket-disappointed-cat/the-cat.jpg)
   ```
   
2. **Paste it as a comment** on any GitHub issue that deserves no more than a cat’s disappointment.  

3. **Hit "Comment" and let the cat do the talking.**  

### Alternative HTML version:  
If you're feeling fancy, or using a platform that doesn't support Markdown, here’s the raw HTML:  
```html
<img src="https://flx.dev/evilsocket-disappointed-cat/the-cat.jpg" alt="disappointed-cat">
```

## Why?  

Because some issues don’t deserve words. Just *The Cat*. 🐱💢  

**Happy disappointing!** 🚀
